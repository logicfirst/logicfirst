### Hello. My name is Scott H Lee and I am a recent graduate of the Software Engineering Bootcamp with Flatiron School.
Our primary languages learned throughout the course were:
- Ruby
- Ruby on Rails
- Javascript
- React.js

with paired or individual projects in each.

I have experience in program and project implementation and management, and am very interested in Agile frameworks for Software Development projects. I am currently seeking a position in Software Development where I can grow, learn, and have an impact.ðŸ‘‹


- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on refactoring/reworking my code for my Rails/React project, Fantasy Congress, to get it out of the design phase and into implementation and deployment.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Agile software Development frameworks such as Scrum and Kanban.

- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about my experience as a business founder, selling to the federal government.
